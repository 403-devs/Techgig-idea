## Idea
The current waste management practices are not only inefficient but also unsustainable, leading to significant environmental degradation and posing a threat to public health and safety, i.e. scattered waste management ecosystem  lacks focus on incentivizing users and contributors to participate in sustainable waste management practices. 

## Solution

Our solution stands out by allowing companies to handle waste management themselves, recycling their products in the most effective way possible.

- We incentivize users to bring their waste to these companies through a token reward system and promote social responsibility and community engagement.
- Our influencer companies' user base will be leveraged to promote our solution, highlighting the benefits of our approach.
- Any company can get involved with our platform as an Influencer company, wherein they will have to provide the users some threshold values to get their tokens redeemed.
- Collaboration with local municipalities will also be pursued to promote our solution and increase adoption.
